## Ember Tutorials

This repository is the future home of the official tutorials on [Emberjs.com](https://emberjs.com).
This is a work in progress and a test at a new source file organization structure and build tooling.

## Contributing

Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Project layout

The Guides' content is in the `source` folder. The left nav bar is produced from
`data/pages.yml`. `lib` contains Middleman plugins, and `spec` contains tests
for those plugins.

## Dependencies

The dependencies for this tutorials application are still in flux.
Currently the tutorials repository only contains the markdown for the tutorials from the guides as well new tutorials that are being added.
